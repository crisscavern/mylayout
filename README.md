#MY Layout
This is  a Layout Repository showcasing all of the different kinds of layout designs I can come up with using CSS Grid.

CSS Grid can be easier and less bloated than tradition Styling. Its simple to design the layout with CSS then directly assign your html <div>s with those classes and ids.

This is an open sourced project so feel free to use some of these designs as a starting point for your projects! #quality coding everyone.
